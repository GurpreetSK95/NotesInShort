WARSAW - President Obama will cut short his four-\nday trip to Europe and instead return to Washington\nfollowing the shooting deaths of five police officers in\nDallas on Thursday, the White House said.\nInstead, Obama will travel to Dallas early next week\nat the invitation of Mayor Mike Rawlings, and devote\n(Photo: MANDEL NGAN,\nmost of his week to addressing the racial and\nAFP/Getty Images)\npolicing issues raised by the events of the past few\ndays, said White House Press Secretary Josh\nEarnest.\nThat announcement capped a long 24 hours in Warsaw, where Obama was meeting\nwith NATO allies. He condemned the videotaped police shootings of two black men in\nLouisiana and Minnesota shortly after touching down in Warsaw, and then awoke to\nthe news of five Dallas police officers being killed by a sniper.\nIn between meetings with European leaders, he called the assault a \"vicious,\ncalculated and despicable attack on law enforcement.\"\n\"I believe I speak for every single American when I say we are horrified over these\nevents, and we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas,\" he\nsaid.\nObama will skip his day of sightseeing and troop visits in southern Spain and instead\nmeet with Spanish officials in Madrid on Sunday. He'll then return to Washington \n Sunday night, a day ahead of schedule.\nObama had been scheduled to visit Seville, where he would have toured the cathedral\nand royal palace with Spanish King Filipe VI. Obama will continue his plans to stop in\nRota, the southern Spanish port city where four U.S. destroyers are based, to tour a\ndestroyer and talk to troops.\nThe decision to cut short a foreign trip is not one that the White House takes lightly.\nObama went ahead with plans to attend a baseball game in Havana with Cuban\nPresident Raul Castro after a terrorist attack in Brussels in March - famously doing\n\"The Wave\" with Castro - and then flew on to Argentina. But last year, he canceled a\nsightseeing trip to the Taj Mahal to instead pay his respects to the new king of Saudi\nArabia, Salman, after the death of his half brother, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz.\nWhite House officials were clearly agonizing over the decision Friday, with Earnest\ntelling reporters it was something they were \"following closely.\"\n\"One of the challenges of the presidency is the person who is entrusted with the\nresponsibility of leading the country has to be able to focus on and devote significant\nattention to more than one priority at a time,\" he said.\nIn a statement later, Earnest said Obama use the week to \"continue the work to bring\npeople together to support our police officers and communities, and find common\nground by discussing policy ideas for addressing the persistent racial disparities in our\ncriminal justice system.\"\nThose seemingly irreconcilable goals came into sharp focus overnight Thursday and\ninto Friday, as Dallas police said at least five officers were killed and seven more\ninjured by gunfire in downtown Dallas during what had been a peaceful protest over\npolice-involved shootings. After almost an hour of negotiations, the heavily armed\ngunman - who was holed up in a building that overlooked the protest route - was\nkilled by police using a robot-controlled explosive device. Three other people have\nbeen arrested.\n\"We will learn more, undoubtedly, about their twisted motivations, but lets be clear:\nThere is no possible justification for these types of attacks,\" Obama said. \"Anyone\ninvolved in the senseless murders will be held fully accountable. Justice will be done.\"\nAs he did earlier Friday, Obama called on Americans to bridge the divide in policeâ€¢\ncommunity relations, supporting officers and their families while addressing racial\ndisparities in police-involved shootings and the criminal justice system at large. And\nrenewed his call for action on gun control: 'We also know that when people are armed\nwith powerful weapons, it makes shootings like this more deadly and more tragic,\" he\nsaid.\nBut he said his immediate concern was for the officers and their families. \"Today is a\nwrenching reminder of the sacrifices they make for us,\" he said. \"They are heartbroken.\nThe entire city of Dallas is grieving. Police across America, which is a tight-knit family,\nfeels this loss to their core. And we're grieving with them.\"\nUSATODAY\nChief: Suspect in Dallas police sloyings 'wonted to kill white\npeople'\nIt was the second time Friday that Obama addressed policing issues as the rapidly\nevolving situation continued to command his attention in Warsaw, where he's attending\na two-day NATO Summit with leaders of the military alliance. Before the summit, he\nalso met with European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission\nPresident Jean-Claude Juncker, focusing largely on the impact that the United\nKingdom's vote to leave the European Union would have on the rest of the continent
