The app skyrocketed to the top of the App Store charts, and is now\\nthe top free app in 46 countries from Germany to Ecuador. In the US and several other countries,\\nthe app is no. 1 in the social networking category, ahead of Facebook, WhatsApp, Kik, and others.\\nIt’s not immediately clear why Telegram emerged as the alternative of choice following WhatsApp’s\\ndowntime. Users could have switched to Kik, or Facebook Messenger, or LINE — all of which have\\nhundreds of millions of users. There’s seemingly something different about Telegram. Its rise isn’t\\nonly due to WhatsApp’s acquisition and subsequent downtime. \\\"We have been the no. 1 app in\\nSpanish, Arabic, and several Latin American app stores for several weeks before the Facebook\\ndeal happened,\\\" says Telegram's Markus Ra. \\\"The growth was there — so the WhatsApp\\nacquisition and problems merely multiplied the effect across all affected countries.\\\" According to\\napp analytics site App Annie, Telegram started truly gaining steam on February 17th, days before\\nthe WhatsApp news even hit.\\nBuilt by the pioneering Durov brothers behind Russia’s largest social network, VKontakte (also\\nknown as VK), Telegram is a messaging service combining the speed of WhatsApp with\\nSnapchat’s ephemerality and advanced new security measures. WhatsApp might have heralded\\nthe first time we heard of Telegram, but it certainly won't be the last.\\nTelegram feels in many ways like a straight-up clone\\nof\\nWhatsApp, from its green double-\\ncheckmark read receipts to its cartoonish wallpapers. There’s also the usual gamut of messaging\\napp features including the ability to see a friend's online status and attach photos, videos, your\\nlocation, contacts, and documents to messages. But where it lacks originality, Telegram makes up\\nfor it in speed and security features. \\\"Telegram is the fastest and most secure mass market\\nmessaging system in the world,\\\" the company claims, which it attributes in part to Nikolai Durov’s\\nopen-sourced MTProto protocol. Telegram was in fact built as a testing bed for MTProto, Reuters\\nreported when the app launched back in August. The company is so confident in the security of\\nMTProto that it’s offering $200,000 to anyone who can crack it. It’s not unusual for companies to\\noffer bug bounties, but bounties of this size are generally only reserved for critical bugs in widely\\nused apps like Windows.\\n\\\"The no. 1 reason for me to support and help launch Telegram was to build a means of\\ncommunication that can’t be accessed by the Russian security agencies,\\\" Durov told TechCrunch.\\nDurov built in a feature that lets you start a \\\"Secret Chat\\\" with any of your friends. According to\\nTelegram, Secret Chats offer end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on the company’s servers, and\\nlet you set Snapchat-esque self-destruct timers on messages that range from two seconds to one\\nweek. There’s also the ability to check the security of your Secret Chats using an image that\\nserves as an encryption key. By comparing your encryption key to a friend’s, you can effectively\\nverify that your conversation is secure and less vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, the\\ncompany says. But despite Telegram’s alleged sophistication, no cryptographic method is infallible.\\nThe company has, in fact, already doled out $100,000 to one developer for finding a critical bug,\\nTechCrunch reports.\",\n" +

He doesn't suggest that anti-police rhetoric could\\nhave caused such violence, as he has before.

That's something demonstrators protesting police violence would certainly agree with;\\nit's a word law enforcement probably wouldn't use to describe the deaths, which will be the subject\\nof investigations that will officially determine whether there was any justification for the shootings.\\nAnd some are\\ntaking\\nissue with Trump's word choice.\\nTrump's statement appears somewhat haphazard. He refers to Sterling and Castile as motorists,\\nfor example, when in fact only Castile was killed operating a vehicle, and he also labels the Dallas\\nkillings \\\"execution-style,\\\" which at least one but not all of the shootings appear to have been. But\\nthe use of the word \\\"senseless\\\" here is clearly meant to try to empathize with a side of the political\\ndebate Trump has often clashed with.\\nIt's also, notably, the first time this week Trump has addressed the deaths of Sterling and Castile.\\nWe've lost track of all the times the Trump campaign was supposed to be pivoting toward the\\ngeneral election and adjusting its tone. This statement represents both a sharp pivot and a starkly\\ndifferent tone.\\nBut \\\"senseless\\\" is a very loaded word in what is a very heated political debate over police violence.\\nAnd it's not loaded in the political direction in which Trump generally veers.\\nThe full Trump statement is below:\\n\\\"Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers - five of whom\\nwere killed and seven wounded - is an attack on our country. It is a coordinated, premeditated\\nassault on the men and women who keep us safe.\\n\\\"We must restore law and order.
